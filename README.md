# Simple Website Generator
Welcome to the Simple Website Generator project! This is a lightweight web-based tool that allows you to quickly and easily create a website by adding headers and paragraphs, and then dragging them up or down to rearrange the content. You can then export your website as a simple .html file with copy-paste code.
